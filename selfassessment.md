Short bio: I am a computer science student focusing on full-stack development and interactive web applications. This enhancement converts a Python text-based adventure into a modular, static web app suitable for GitHub Pages and portfolio presentation.

## Overview

&emsp;[Whispering Woods](https://duane-wegner.github.io/Whispering-Woods/index.html) is a browser-hosted enhancement of an [original Python text-based adventure](/Artifact%20File/Whispering-Woods.py). This enhancement converts the original artifact into a static, GitHub Pages–friendly application implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. All game state is persisted locally (localStorage) and the admin overlay is local-only for easy editing during development.

&emsp;A video code review of the original artifact is available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfQXntvhU68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfQXntvhU68)

&emsp;Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative experience that has helped me showcase my technical strengths, shape my professional goals, and prepare to enter the field of computer science as a competent and employable developer. Over the past two years, I have gained hands-on experience across multiple programming languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and Java. These experiences have allowed me to develop a strong foundation in software engineering principles, algorithms, data structures, and database design, which I have applied in both academic and practical projects.

&emsp;Throughout the program, I have developed the ability to collaborate effectively in team environments, using version control systems to coordinate work, manage branches, and integrate code with peers. I have also strengthened my communication skills by documenting project requirements, writing technical reports, and providing clear explanations of complex concepts. These experiences have reinforced my ability to translate technical knowledge into actionable solutions that are understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.

&emsp;In addition to the projects featured in my ePortfolio, I have completed several other technical projects that have further developed my skills. I created an Android inventory application that tracks items dynamically, demonstrating my ability to work with mobile interfaces, implement object-oriented design, and manage data structures efficiently. In another project, I developed a 3D image rendering of a desk, which allowed me to explore computational graphics, coordinate transformations, and visual representation of objects. I have also gained practical experience working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, designing and implementing persistent storage solutions for multiple applications. These experiences provided a solid foundation in database management, data modeling, and efficient data retrieval.

&emsp;My work with data structures and algorithms has strengthened my ability to design and implement efficient, scalable, and reliable solutions. I have created dynamic inventory systems, implemented pathfinding algorithms for game exploration, and optimized navigation and storage mechanisms. These experiences have improved my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are essential for any professional in computer science.

&emsp;Software engineering and database management have been central to my development as a programmer. I have designed modular and maintainable code architectures, implemented interactive front-end interfaces, and integrated persistent data storage systems. Security has been an ongoing focus, and I have applied defensive coding practices, secure storage techniques, and validation methods to mitigate potential vulnerabilities, reinforcing a security-conscious approach to software design.

&emsp;The artifacts included in my ePortfolio reflect a progression of skills and demonstrate a range of competencies that work together to illustrate my capabilities. Whispering Woods highlights my ability to convert a Python text-based game into a web-based interactive application, showcasing my skills in software engineering, algorithmic design, data structures, and database integration. Each enhancement demonstrates growth in modular coding, scalability, and secure data management, providing concrete evidence of my technical expertise. Together, these artifacts form a cohesive portfolio that presents a comprehensive view of my abilities and readiness to contribute effectively in a professional setting.

&emsp;This professional self-assessment serves as an introduction to my ePortfolio and illustrates my strengths as a computer science professional. It emphasizes my ability to collaborate, communicate, design efficient solutions, implement software and database systems, and maintain secure practices. The artifacts that follow provide tangible examples of these skills in action and collectively demonstrate my preparedness to meet the demands of a career in computer science.
