### Enhancement 1: Algorithmic and User Interface Improvements
  
### Description of the Enhancement
&emsp;Enhancement 2 improved algorithmic logic and user experience. Features added included breadth-first search pathfinding hints, enhanced inventory management, fog-of-war map updates, and algorithm testing pages.
  
### Justification for Inclusion
&emsp;This enhancement demonstrates skills in designing efficient algorithms, integrating game logic with the user interface, and creating scalable systems. Pathfinding, dynamic inventory, and algorithm testing highlight competency in data structures, object manipulation, and optimization. The artifact was improved by increasing interactivity, responsiveness, and algorithmic sophistication.
  
### Justification for Inclusion</h3>Reflection on the Process
&emsp;I learned to balance performance with complexity, integrate algorithms into the user interface, and design testable components. Challenges included managing interactions between algorithm outputs and user interface updates and debugging pathfinding logic. Feedback from self-testing and peer reviews guided improvements in performance and usability.
  
### Justification for Inclusion</h3>Course Outcomes Achieved
- Outcome 1 Collaborative Environments: Achieved. Continued use of GitHub branches and overlay sharing for team workflow.
- Outcome 2 Professional Communication: Achieved. Improved in-app guidance, clear interface labels, and structured documentation.
- Outcome 3 Design and Evaluate Computing Solutions: Achieved. Pathfinding, dynamic room logic, and inventory optimization implemented.
- Outcome 4 Techniques Skills and Tools: Achieved. Modular JavaScript patterns, responsive CSS, and client-side persistence.
- Outcome 5 Security Mindset: Achieved. Client-side hashed admin login, namespaced storage, and input validation applied.
