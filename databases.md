### Enhancement 3: Full-Stack Integration and Admin Features

### Description of the Enhancement
&emsp;Enhancement 3 implemented full-stack integration and advanced admin features. Features include import and export of overlay JSON files, namespaced localStorage for admin edits, runtime merge and patch logic, improved admin interface, and defensive coding practices.

### Justification for Inclusion
&emsp;This enhancement highlights expertise in full-stack concepts, data handling, and secure coding. Overlay import and export, namespaced storage, and merge logic demonstrate modular design, effective data management, and security practices. The artifact was improved by supporting collaborative editing, maintaining data integrity, and enhancing administrative controls.

### Reflection on the Process
&emsp;Through this enhancement, I learned advanced data management techniques, defensive coding strategies, and best practices for persistence in JavaScript. Challenges included ensuring reliable merge logic for overlays and preventing accidental data loss. Feedback from code reviews helped improve documentation, error handling, and user guidance.

### Course Outcomes Achieved
- Outcome 1 Collaborative Environments: Achieved. Overlay JSON import and export enables collaboration and sharing of artifacts.
- Outcome 2 Professional Communication: Achieved. Project documentation, clear interface labels, and inline technical comments communicate effectively to users and stakeholders.
- Outcome 3 Design and Evaluate Computing Solutions: Achieved. Canonical data model, overlay application, and algorithm demos validate design and solution evaluation skills.
- Outcome 4 Techniques Skills and Tools: Achieved. ES modules, fetch API, Blob downloads, structuredClone, and modular storage abstraction demonstrate modern computing techniques.
- Outcome 5 Security Mindset: Achieved. Defensive coding, validation before applying overlays, and namespaced storage ensure secure artifact manipulation.
